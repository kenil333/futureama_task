# futureama_task

A new Flutter Futureama Task Project project was created with Flutter version 3.7.12.

## Getting Started

The starting point of the cod is the main.dart.

To run the project there is a two way:
1. Use an IDE like Android Studio or Visual Studio Code, IDEs provides the direct run mechanism.
2. You can run the 'flutter run' command in the terminal of the project.

To build the Android APK run the following command:

'flutter build apk --split-per-abi'

The above command results in 3 different APKs.


In the Project structure, there is one directory called apk, which has the Android build, you can use that android build for testing also. (apk/quiztask.apk)
